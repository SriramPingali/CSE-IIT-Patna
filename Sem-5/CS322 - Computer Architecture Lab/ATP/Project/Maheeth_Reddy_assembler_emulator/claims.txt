*The C++ source codes submitted asm.cpp, emu.cpp and this claims.txt have my name and roll number at the start, along with a declaration of authorship.

Eight test files that were used for testing are also included. The evidence for Assembler includes output files from 8 test examples which are also uploaded.
They are test01(3 output files), test02(2 output files),test03(3 output files), test04(3 output files), test05(3 output files), test06(3 output files),
test07(2 output files) and test08(2 output files).

The test files test01.asm - test04.asm were provided for testing, hence they are not authored by me.
The test files test05.asm - test08.asm were written by me for testing, they include my name, roll number at the start, along with a declaration of authorship.

All the test files have been tested and work properly.

The evidence for Emulator includes the output files from 5 test examples has also been uploaded.
They are test01.txt, test03.txt, test04.txt, test05.txt and test06.txt.

*My source code for Assembler, asm.cpp and for Emulator, emu.cpp did not show any errors and warnings when I compiled them with g++

*The Source Codes are compilable with g++ asm.cpp -o asm and g++ emu.cpp -o emu


=============================
Program format and structure:
=============================
1. The Assembler:

    * Consistent and sensible formatting with sensible program structure.
    * Sensible variable, function & type names with explanatory comments.
    * Consists of two data structures to store respectively labels and mnemonic table with expected operands.
    * Reads input file only once and stores it into an internal format in first pass.
    * Detects label errors in second pass only. The following errors are detected:
        * Duplicate labels
        * Missing labels
        * Unused Labels
        * Labels with invalid naming i.e., don’t begin with alphabet, not alphanumeric
        * Mnemonics that are given operands though not required
        * Mnemonics that are not given operands though required
        * Invalid Mnemonic
    * Machine code, log file are generated only in the second pass.
    * Advanced listing file is generated in second pass
    * Accepts numbers in decimal, hexadecimal and octal format.
    * Can implement and demonstrate the instruction SET.
    * Allows label names to contain alphabets, numbers, and underscore but they can start with only alphabets or underscore.
	* Assembles test programs.
    * Notifies user if input file can't be opened.

2. The Emulator:

    * With data structures to store respectively memory, mnemonic table with expected operands.
    * Loads object file.
    * By giving the instructions like "-before/-after" , the program can produce memory dump before/after execution.
    * By giving the instruction like "-trace", the program prints the result of program executed.
    * By giving the instruction like "-isa", the program prints the instruction set of SIMPLE assembly language.
    * Detects errant programs.
    * Notifies user if input file can't be opened.

Testing:
=============================

1. The Assembler:

I have tested 8 examples shown as below. Errors occurred in the files test02.asm, test07.asm and test08.asm.
The program immediately stopped on the second pass.

A warning was given in the file test01.asm for having an unused label.

The others were tested without any errors detected and produced (including test01.asm)
three output files, listing file, error log file and machine readable object file.

The output files, warnings and error messages for each test file have been listed below:

1)
#Input: ./asm test01.asm
#Output: 
a. test01.l 
b. test01.log (1 warning)
c. test01.o

warning message:
WARNING:line 6  Unused Label found: "label:     ; an unused label"

2)
#Input: ./asm test02.asm
#Output: 
a. test02.l 
b. test02.log (error messages shown as below but also in log file)

error messages:
ERROR:line 8    Duplicate Label found: "label: ; duplicate label definiton"
ERROR:line 10   Label doesn't begin with alphabet: "ldc 08ge ; not a number"
ERROR:line 11   This mnemonic requires a parameter: "ldc ; missing operand"
ERROR:line 12   This mnemonic doesn't require a parameter: "add 5 ; unexpected operand"

2. The Emulator:

I have tested 5 examples as shown below. The output files, warnings and error messages for each test file have been listed:

1)
#Input:./emu -trace test01.o
#Output: test01.txt

Note: Execution Failed to complete. The corresponding assembly program was provided for testing and contains an infinite loop.
      So the execution had to be terminated.

2)
#Input: ./emu -trace test03.o
#Output: test02.txt

Note: Execution Failed to complete. The corresponding assembly program was provided for testing and doesn't contain a HALT instruction.
      The execution was terminated automatically by the shell with this message

      Segmentation Fault

3)
#Input: ./emu -trace test04.o
#Output: test04.txt

4)
#Input: ./emu -trace test05.o
#Output: test05.txt

5)
#Input: ./emu -trace test06.o
#Output: test06.txt
