# General Part : 

*All the files i submitted, asm.cpp, emu.cpp and claims.txt, have my name and roll number at the start, along with a declaration of authorship.

The evidence for Assembler including the output files from the 7 (4 given and 3 additional) test examples has also been uploaded. 
They are test01(3 output files), test02(2 output files), test03 (3 output file), test04.asm(3 output files), test05.asm(3 output files), 
test06.asm(3 output files), test07.asm(3 output files). All the test files have been tested and work properly. Evidence is submitted in the
Report. 

As for the evidence of emulator is uploaded with 7 output files (from trace option) for files assembled without errors. 

My source file compiles without error and creates a executable on using following command (g++ asm.cpp -o asm)

My source file compiles without warnings (g++ asm.cpp -o asm).

=============================
Program format and structure:
=============================

1. The assembler:

I have used consistent and sensible formatting with sensible program structure.

I have used sensible variable, function and type names with explanatory comments in the source code file (asm.cpp)

I have used a single process for both passes

I have successfully diagnosed label errors like duplicate, missing, invalid format 
I have successfully diagnosed instruction errors like no such instruction, invalid operand, unexpected operand 
(Proof for these errors can be seen in test02.log file)

I have successfully created advanced listing file for every test file
Format for Listing File :  ProgramCounter => MachineCode => Instruction 
(More details can be seen in test0x.lst (x is from 1 to 4))

My source code has tables of instruction names and expected operands.
( 
I have used map data structure to store the following formats :
	instructions_without_operand
	instructions_with_one_operand
	instructions_with_pcoffset 
)

My source assembles all the provided test programs identifying appropraite errors, and if there are no errors it produces corressponding object 
file( Output for a valid input assembly program (.asm) will include : .log , .lst and .o files ) 

.log file contains => declared labels, used labels, errors and warnings (errors and warnings are also available in terminal output if they exist)
.lst file contains => listing file (format mentioned above)
.o file contains => object file contains machine code according to specification mentioned 

I have also implemented SET instruction. It is demonstrated through test03 program

2. The emulator :

I have implemented emulator using data structures to store all valid instructions(along with their format), memory (as machine_code and machine_code_int)

It loads object file and is with following options :

		Check Format : ./emu [options] filename.o
		-trace  show instruction trace
		-read   show memory reads
		-write  show memory writes
		-before show memory dump before execution
		-after  show memory dump after execution
		-wipe   wipe written flags before execution (flags means I have considered reg_A, reg_B, stack_pointer and program_counter)
		-isa    display ISA

It also detect errorneous programs if they have accessed memory location out of the boundary, or instruction opcode does not exists

I am assuming all SET and data instructions are after HALT in the provided assembly code 


=============================
Testing:
=============================

1. The assembler:

I have tested  7 examples shown as bellow. The errors only occurred in the file test02.asm and the program immediately stopped on the second
pass. The others were tested without any errors detected and produced three output files, listing file,error log file and machine readable object 
file, for each example. 


1)
#Input: asm test01.asm
#Output: 
a. test01.lst 
b. test01.log (without any error messages)
c. test1.o

2)
#Input:asm test02.asm
#Output: 
a. test02.lst
b. test02.log (with error messages shown as below but also in log file)

Errors 
Line 0 : No such Label
Line 0 : Not a Valid Number Format,Use Suitable Prefix For hex = '0x', oct = '0'
Line 4 : Duplicate Label Definition
Line 7 : No Operand found
Line 8 : Unexpected Operand, No Operand is allowed
Line 9 : Unexpected Operand, Only One Operand is allowed
Line 10 : Invalid Label Name, Only include alphanumeric, start with alphabets only
Line 11 : No such insruction
Line 12 : No such insruction

3)
#Input:asm test03.asm
#Output: 
a. test03.lst 
b. test03.log (without any error messages)
c. test03.o

4)
#Input:asm test04.asm  (This is same as triangle.asm)
#Output: 
a. test04.lst 
b. test04.log (without any error messages)
c. test04.o

5)
#Input:asm test05.asm
#Output: 
a. test05.lst 
b. test05.log (without any error messages)
c. test05.o

6)
#Input:asm test06.asm
#Output: 
a. test06.lst 
b. test06.log (without any error messages)
c. test06.o

7)
#Input:asm test07.asm
#Output: 
a. test07.lst 
b. test07.log (without any error messages)
c. test07.o

# Bubble Sort Program :

#Input:asm MyBubbleSort.asm
#Output: 
a. MyBubbleSort.lst 
b. MyBubbleSort.log (without any error messages)
c. MyBubbleSort.o

# The emulator part :

I have tested in total 7 examples(including MyBubbleSort.o) from the given files test01.o needs to be aborted as it has infinite loop

The others were tested without any errors detected and produced excution data. I have redirected the output data to txt files which are uploaded.(test01.txt(incomplete as it was aborted),test03.txt,..,test07.txt and MyBubbleSort.txt) 


1)
#Input: emu -trace test01.o >> test01.txt
#Output: manually aborted (infinite loop)

2)
#Input: emu -trace test02.o >> test02.txt
#Output: Error : No such file exists

3)
#Input: emu -trace test03.o >> test03.txt
#Output:
a. test03.txt

4)
#Input: emu -trace test04.o >> test04.txt
#Output:
a. test04.txt

5)
#Input: emu -trace test05.o >> test05.txt
#Output:
a. test05.txt

6)
#Input: emu -trace test06.o >> test06.txt
#Output:
a. test06.txt

7)
#Input: emu -trace test07.o >> test07.txt
#Output:
a. test07.txt

# Bubble Sort Program :

#Input: emu -trace MyBubbleSort.o >> MyBubbleSort.txt
#Output:
a. MyBubbleSort.txt

Examples for other options are in the Report
